# Bean Age Calculator

## Calculating the Bean Age
Let's start from the beginning. Among Us tweeted this (retrieved on March 30th, 2021):

The suspended account was asking the age of the manager. (I remember seeing the tweet when it was first sent!)

Recently, I found this tweet again and decided to go on a hunt. And, it took me literally no time at all! If you don't know the social media manager already, their name is Victoria Tran. I remember seeing a tweet about it from Innersloth, but this is the earliest thing I could find:

After simply doing a search, I found a tweet of them celebrating their birthday! I won't share it here without Victoria's permission for privacy reasons (although it was only last year), but it was right there in front of me!

So, 226 days are between their birthday and the original bean years tweet. That's `0.619178082192`. Combining it with their age, then dividing `630594` by that number, gives us the grand result of: `23689.4617126`!

Then, I formed the website :]
